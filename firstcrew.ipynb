      "\n",
      "- **John Doe** is assigned to define the project scope as the Project Manager, which aligns perfectly with his role, ensuring leadership and effective management of stakeholder expectations.\n",
      "- **Bob Smith** is allocated high-effort design tasks due to his expertise as a Designer, ensuring the UI/UX meets modern standards while managing complexity effectively.\n",
      "- **Jane Doe**, a Software Engineer, is tasked with content-related work because the tasks leverage her development capabilities while also assigning her to the building of the website. This approach balances her workload across various stages of the project.\n",
      "- The **QA Engineers**, Alice Johnson and Tom Brown, are jointly assigned to quality assurance tasks, allowing for thorough testing and feedback loops, which are crucial in identifying bugs and ensuring project quality.\n",
